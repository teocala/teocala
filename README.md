### Hello to everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am a research assistant at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), Denmark, and previously a MSc student in Computational Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland. 
I use GitHub for several projects that you can also see on my [website](https://www.matteocalafa.com). Most of the works are focused on what I really love: numerical analysis for differential problems, stochastic simulations and machine learning.
