### Hello to everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am a master student in Computational Science at `EPFL`, Switzerland. I use GitHub for several university projects that you can also see on my [website](https://www.matteocalafa.com). These are mainly focused on what I really love: numerical analysis for differential problems, stochastic simulations and machine learning.
