### Hello to everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 
I am a PhD student at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/), Denmark, and previously a MSc student in Computational Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland. 
I use GitHub for several projects that you can also see on my [website](https://www.matteocalafa.com). Most of the works are focused on what I really love: scientific computing, numerical analysis and machine learning.
